## Board Files

RFSoC4x2 board files are not directly available in the Vivado repository.
They can be found in the GitHub link below:

Add the following lines to the `Vivado_init.tcl` file with

```tcl
set_param board.repoPaths [list "/path/to/board_files"]
```

Here the path has the directory `rfsoc4x2`.
