# IP Cores

Using IP cores for RFSoC development is a common practice.
We do not want to reinvent the wheel all the time.
It is already painful to get the RFSoC hardware up and running in a research project.

Some useful open-source IP libraries[^1]:
- [1G/10G/25G Ethernet](https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-ethernet) for Verilog
- [AXI Utilities](https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-axi) & [AXIS Utilities](https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-axis) for Verilog

[^1]: All These libraries have been tested by [Wuqiong Zhao](https://wqzhao.org).
